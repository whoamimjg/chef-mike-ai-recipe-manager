# Grocery Store API Setup Guide

Your Chef Mike's app now supports **real grocery store pricing** from major retailers! Here's how to get authentic pricing data instead of mock data.

## Option 1: Kroger API (Recommended - FREE) ‚úÖ

**Coverage**: 2,700+ stores nationwide  
**Cost**: Free tier with 1000 calls/day  
**Setup Time**: 10 minutes  

### Steps to Get Real Kroger Pricing:

1. **Register**: Go to [developer.kroger.com](https://developer.kroger.com/)
2. **Create Account**: Sign up with your business email
3. **Complete Tutorial**: Kroger requires a quick knowledge check
4. **Create App**: 
   - App Name: "Chef Mike's Recipe App"
   - Description: "Recipe management with shopping list pricing"
   - Website: Your Replit app URL
5. **Get Credentials**: Copy your Client ID and Client Secret

### Add to Your App:
In your Replit secrets (üîí icon in left sidebar), add:
- `KROGER_CLIENT_ID`: Your client ID from Kroger
- `KROGER_CLIENT_SECRET`: Your client secret from Kroger

**That's it!** Your app will automatically start showing real Kroger prices.

## Option 2: Target API (Requires Approval)

**Coverage**: 1,800+ Target stores  
**Cost**: Free for approved partners  
**Setup Time**: 2-4 weeks approval process  

### Steps:
1. Apply at [partners.target.com](https://partners.target.com/)
2. Provide business documentation
3. Wait for approval (typically 2-4 weeks)
4. Add `TARGET_API_KEY` to your secrets

## Option 3: Walmart (Limited Access)

**Status**: No public grocery API available  
**Alternative**: Walmart Marketplace API (sellers only)  

Walmart doesn't offer public grocery pricing APIs. You'd need to:
- Become a Walmart marketplace seller, OR
- Use third-party scraping services (not recommended)

## Option 4: Third-Party Aggregators

If you want **multiple stores** at once:

### Actowiz Solutions
- **Coverage**: Kroger, Walmart, Target, Safeway, Whole Foods
- **Cost**: $99-999/month based on usage
- **Setup**: Contact [actowizsolutions.com](https://actowizsolutions.com)

### FoodSpark
- **Coverage**: 50+ grocery chains
- **Cost**: $0.01-0.10 per API call
- **Setup**: Register at [foodspark.io](https://foodspark.io)

## How It Works in Your App

Once you add API keys, here's what happens:

1. **User clicks "Show Prices"** on shopping list
2. **App tries real APIs first** (Kroger, Target, etc.)
3. **Real pricing displays** with store names, sales, availability
4. **Fallback to mock data** only if APIs fail

### Example Real Data:
```
üè™ Kroger Store #123
ü•õ Milk, 1 Gallon: $3.49 (was $3.99) ‚úÖ In Stock üè∑Ô∏è ON SALE

üéØ Target Store #456  
ü•õ Milk, 1 Gallon: $3.79 ‚úÖ In Stock
```
